# Hi there!
## Welcome to my personal page

It looks a little barren right now but thats because I just put it up.

Either this or my Github URL could fit in my resume and I figured 
this would have more long term flexibility

More information coming soon!
For now you can click the link below to get to my GitHub.

[my github](https://github.com/quietimcoding/)

Again super sorry about the extra clicking. This website will be more complete soon.
