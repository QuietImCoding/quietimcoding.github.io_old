    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my personal page</h2>
    <br>
    <p>It looks a little barren right now but that's because I just put it up.</p>
    <p>Either this or my GitHub URL could fit in my resume and I figured, I could put more information here so...</p>
    <br>
    <p>More information coming soon!</p>
    <p>For now you can click the link below to get to my github</p>
    <br>
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/quietimcoding/">https://github.com/quietimcoding/</a></h4>

    <p>Again, super sorry about the extra clicking. This website should be super cool soon</p>
